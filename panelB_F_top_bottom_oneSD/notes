Comparison between Low and High CAS.PA  groups for the DFNA5 effect yields a p-value of 0.0391

the effect of DFNA5 on log10_TMB_perMB is significantly negative in the Low CASPA group (slope ≈ -0.058), and it becomes even more negative in the High CASPA group (slope ≈ -0.083) due to the interaction term. The p-value for the interaction (-0.02504, p = 0.0391) indicates that this difference in slopes between the Low and High groups is statistically significant.

High and Low are defined by Mean -/+ 1SD
Comparison between Low and High DFNA5 groups for the CAS.PA effect yields a p-value of 0.000129

The very low p-values (< 2e-16 for the main effects and 0.000129 for the interaction term) indicate that all these coefficients are statistically significant. In practical terms, the effect of CAS.PA on log10 TMB per MB is significantly stronger (steeper) in the DFNA5 Low group compared to the DFNA5 High group.
